## Enhanced backgrounds (BKG)


The BKG or "Background" mod allows backgrounds to be modularly configured using json files without needing to recompile the source.


Please see [this page](https://wiki.doukutsu.club/bkg-hack) for more info on BKG in general, as well as other implementations for other Cave Story engines.


The BKG mod adds the following commands to TSC:


- `<BKGname_of_config$` - Loads the BKG config file from `./data/bkg` with `name_of_config`. (`$` is string delimiter)
- `<BKDwwww` - Disable the background layer `wwww`. (out-of-range layers will be set to the last layer)
- `<BKEwwww` - Enable background layer. (similar to `BKD`)
- `<BKPwwww:xxxx:yyyy` - Set `BKG` parameter `xxxx` for layer `wwww` to value `yyyy`. *(TODO: negatives and floating points)*
- `<BKR` - Restores background to default parameters for the map, similar to a `TRA` command.

    }
    //invalid parameter: do nothing
    _ => {}
}
```


When setting scroll flags from a `BKP` command, they are set using a bitfield, similar to how items are equipped on the player with the vanilla command `EQ+`. Raise 2 to the power of the shift count for the parameter seen in the code above and add all parameter numbers together to set the flags.


Example:
```
Flag: align with water is value 2^4=16
Flag: follow_pc_x is value 2^0=1
Flag: autoscroll_y = 2^3=8


Total: 25


Setting all these flags to TRUE and all others to FALSE will use the value 0025.


This is the command to set these flags on layer 0:
<BKP0000:0018:0025


```
*(Note: if the bitfield sum is larger than `9999`, out-of-bounds TSC values will need to be used. The value of non-number TSC is based on its distance from `0` on the ASCII table. For example, `999:` is parsed as `10000`)*

### Config File Layout


To save the effort of running multiple TSC commands for each background config, all configuration data is stored in a json file in the `./data/bkg` directory.
These files can have any name, and the bitmap they load is determined by the fields within the file.


- `version` - config version number, this should not be edited by the user, since it tells the engine how to deal with the config file. Files that are out of date will automatically be updated and re-saved by the engine when it tries to load them.
- `bmp_filename` - what image file to load from the `./data` directory (Note: the image file does *not* have to exclusively be a bitmap: d-rs can handle .png and .pbm as well. Either of these filetypes will work just the same, despite the bmp naming convention used here)
- `lighting_mode` - what type of ambient lighting d-rs uses. Types are:
    - None (0),
    - BackgroundOnly (1),
    - Ambient (2),
- `layers` - a list of each layer to be drawn on the background, the first entry in the list will be drawn at the back, and the other entries will work their way up from there.
- `bmp_x_offset` /  `bmp_y_offset` - the top left corner on the background image where the rect to draw for this layer is
- `bmp_width` / `bmp_height` - how wide and tall the rect to draw should be
- `draw_repeat_x` / `draw_repeat_y` - how many times to repeat the bitmap, starting from the top left corner and extending right and down. To repeat a definite count in the other direction, apply a negative value to the `draw_corner_offset` fields. If these are set to 0, they will repeat infinitely in both directions (left/right or up/down).
- `draw_repeat_gap_x` / `draw_repeat_gap_y` how much space to have between bitmap "tiles", in pixels.
- `draw_corner_offset_x` / `draw_corner_offset_y` - offset from the top left corner where the tiles should begin drawing
- `animation_style` sub-group that controls how the background moves and changes
- `frame_count` - how many frames of animation the layer should have, 0 and 1 both do the same thing
- `frame_start` - what animation number to start on, [0 thru frame_count-1]
- `animation_speed` - how many ingame ticks it takes to advance the frame by 1
- `follow_speed_x` / `follow_speed_y` - how fast the background follows the camera's motion. For it to move with the foreground, set these values to `1.0`. For the classic "slow follow" effect, set them to `0.5`. They can also be negative. These will only be active if the flags `follow_pc_x` / `follow_pc_y` are set to `true`.
- `autoscroll_speed_x` / `autoscroll_speed_y` - same as `follow_speed` parameters, but apply to the autoscrolling. Units are speed * 1 pixel per second.
- `scroll_flags` - determines what properties to apply to the scrolling, the parameters of which are outlined above.
- `follow_pc_x` / `follow_pc_y` - the background will move as a multiple of the user's camera.
- `autoscroll_x` / `autoscroll_y` - the background will move as a multiple of time
- `align_with_water_lvl` - will follow the global water level, like what's used in the Core fight
- `draw_above_foreground` - draws the background above the frontmost tile layer
- `random_offset_x` / `random_offset_y` - only applies to the opposite autoscroll mode with a finite number of `draw_repeat`. Each time the last rect in the chain goes offscreen, it will loop back on the other side. If this field is set to `true` it will have a randomized `x`/`y` value. This is good for things like clouds, where you'd set it to autoscroll along the x axis, but enable the `random_offset_y` flag to have each "cloud" come back onscreen with a randomized height. The amount that this value will deviate each time is between `-animation_speed` and `animation_speed`.
- `lock_to_x_axis` / `lock_to_y_axis` - locks the map's background to either the X or Y axis by compounding x1 frame movement onto the current offset. This same effect can be achieved with other settings, but this can be combined with other settings to create different effects.
- `add_screen_width` / `add_screen_height` - adds the width or height of the window to the background layer, this is useful for aligning the layer with the right or bottom edge of the screen instead of the top or left. What is added changes based on the the values of `relative_to_pillarbox` / `relative_to_letterbox`.
- `relative_to_pillarbox` / `relative_to_letterbox` - Changes what is regarded as an "edge" to the background layer. For small maps or wide screens, there may be black "strips" along the sides or bottom of the viewing window. If these settings are enabled, the background will align itself with the edge of this black strip instead of the actual edge of the window. Typically, these should be `true` if there is detail on a background layer that is only repeated a few times, or is at risk of being covered by the black "strips". *If you're unsure on how to use these, it's safer to set them to `true`.*

}

*(to try this out ingame, name it something like `background_name.json` and place it in the `/data/bkg` directory, then load it in with `<BKGbackground_name$`)*




## Layers


Layers mode adds the ability to draw four distinct maps' worth of tiles directly on top of each other, simplifying tileest bitmaps and allowing for some interesting layouts. It also extends the builtin tileset limit so the tilesets themselves can be much larger.


Please see [this page](https://wiki.doukutsu.club/layers-mode) for a more in-depth explanation on how the layer mod works.


In addition to support for layers, the following commands have been added to interface with them:




- `<CMLwwww:xxxx:yyyy:zzzz` - Sets the tile at (xxxx,yyyy) to type zzzz, on layer wwww [0/back, 1/mid, 2/fore, 3/far fore]
- `<SMLwwww:xxxx:yyyy` - Subtracts 1 from tile type at (xxxx,yyyy) on layer wwww [0/back, 1/mid, 2/fore, 3/far fore]



## Animated tiles

The animated tiles option allows tiles to change their color on a predefined tick interval, just like the `animation_speed` parameter of `<BKG`. The tile animations are configured with a `.json` file placed in the `./data/Stage` directory. This `.json` must have the same name as the tileset it will be loaded with. For example, a `.json` with name `Cave.json` will be loaded with the tileset `PrtCave.bmp` +  `Cave.pxa`. If the `.json` is not correctly formatted or not present, it will simply be ignored and the tileset will be loaded as normal.

Here are the fields for the animated tile config file:

- `version` - config version number, this should not be edited by the user, since it tells the engine how to deal with the config file. Files that are out of date will automatically be updated and re-saved by the engine when it tries to load them.
- `tiles` - a list of each tile to have an animation.
- `tile_id` - which tile from the bitmap should recieve this animation. The tile is indexed from `0` at the top left corner from left to right. For `.pxa` files, it is indexed by `16` pixels. For `.pxpack` *(kero-blaster)* files, it is indexed by `8`. This behaves similar to how the stock `<CMP` command works.
*Note: if multiple entries share the same `tile_id`, it will only use the configuration from the last one in the list.*
- `animation_speed` - how many ingame ticks it takes to advance the frame by 1
- `frame_start` - what animation number to start on, values larger than the number of frames will be wrapped
- `frame` - list of tile RECTs to render in sequence, selected in the same manner as the `tile_id`. *(Note: this affects what the tile **looks like** only. It does not affect collision, which is still that of `tile_id`.)*
 
Here's an example of a file:
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "tiles": [
    {
      "tile_id": 60,
      "animation_speed": 8,
      "frame_start": 0,
      "frame": [
        60,
        61,
        62,
        63,
        64,
        65
      ]
    },
	{
      "tile_id": 65,
      "animation_speed": 8,
      "frame_start": 5,
      "frame": [
        60,
        61,
        62,
        63,
        64,
        65
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
*(to try this out ingame, name it something like `Cave.json` and place it in the `/data/Stage` directory, then load any map that uses the `Cave` tileset and this will be loaded along side it)*
