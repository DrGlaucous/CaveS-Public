with a tif image, grafx2 looks first for the "software ID" "Grafx2" at the bottom of the file
if it find that, it then looks for it's "TIFFTAG" with value:
short: 65500
hex: 0xDCFF
int: 0x0000DCFF

the important value is 8 bytes from then end of this "TIFFTAG" (0 for layered, 1 for animation)

if there are multiple hits of this tag, usually editing the first one is good enough to change the mode

//layers mode
0x00 00 00 00

//anim mode
0x00 00 01 00
