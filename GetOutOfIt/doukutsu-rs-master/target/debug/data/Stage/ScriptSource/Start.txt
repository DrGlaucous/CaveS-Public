Welcome to Getting Out of It,
Your goal is to get Kanpachi out
of the depths of this island.

In case you don't know who
Kanpachi is, he's the little
rabbit-like fellow in the bucket.

He likes to fish, but right now,
he's using his fishing pole to
climb the steep cave walls.
//////////////
Throughout the playthough,
I will NOT be saving your
progress and mistakes...

Because you can do it yourself.
There's a save button in the
pause menu.

Feel free to save when you make a
breakthrough, or when you fall all
the way back to the start.

I believe that how hard you want
the experience to
be is completely up to you.

I won't be commenting on your
mistakes and pitfalls because
again, I leave it in your hands.

//////////////

This game pays homage to two
previous titles:
Cave Story and Getting Over It
with Bennet Foddy.

The first game is pretty obvious,
isn't it?
You probably wouldn't even know
this mod exsists if you haven't
at least tried the original
game first
and shown a minute iota of
interest in it.

As for the second game by
Mr. Foddy, that one may
have some players at a disconnect.

If you don't know what that is,
I suggest you pause this mod now,
look it up, maybe play it, then
come back.

If it wasn't a good
game, I wouldn't have made this
mod now, would I.

//////////////////////

Ironically enough, Getting Over It
is itself a homage to an even
older game, Sexy Hiking.

In Foddy's commentary, which
plays in the game much like
what you're reading now,

he explains that Sexy Hiking
was never meant to
be a high quality game,

but was rather a fun challenge for
the creator to make. The game is
hard and controls poorly,

making it a very fustrating
experience for any prospective
players (ask me how I know).

////////////////////////////

Foddy's game, on the other hand,
is polished and complete, and
is both fair and controls well,
even if it is challenging at times.

This game, although more directly
inspired by Getting Over It, has
more in common with Sexy Hiking.

It is the product of a passion for
game creation less than a desire
for a smooth user experience.

////////////////////////////////////

The physics are poor, the backend
cobbled, and the final result
rushed.

To see this for yourself, take that
fishing rod of yours and ram it
hard into one of the walls.

You might be suprised to see it go
all the way though or get stuck
inside.

Use this mechanic as you will.
I can't complain. I made it.
I left it in.

It was my choice,
made in light of lack of skill
and tight time constraints.
It's part of the game now.

/////////////////////////////////

Kind of like that Discovery TV
watermark in the bottom right
corner,

A remnant of what this mod's base
came from, which was originally
themed around the Mythbusters.

It's something I chose to keep for
my own amusement, rather than for
polish or user reception.

///////////////////////////////

Much like how Sexy Hiking used MS
MS paint graphics and MIDI-smash
music,

or how you can clip or snap
off obstacles and find yourself
falling out of the world.

It was a project of passion,
not one of polish.


///////////////////////////////

But still you play,
despite the game's poor
presentation.

You've taken some of your
precious time to take part in my
passion.

////////////////////////////////

Even if you break the game, cheese
it, or breeze through it,
you still got here.

And for that, I thank you.
I thank you for playing my mod.
