<MS2<TURWelcome to Getting Out of It.
Your goal is to get Kanpachi out
of the depths of this island.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIn case you don't know who
Kanpachi is, he's the little
rabbit-like fellow in the bucket.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURHe likes to fish, but right now,
he's using his fishing pole to
climb the steep cave walls.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURThroughout the playthough,
I will NOT be saving your
progress and mistakes...<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURBecause you can do it yourself.
There's a save button in the
pause menu.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURFeel free to save when you make a
breakthrough, or when you fall all
the way back to the start.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURI believe that how hard you want
the experience to
be is completely up to you.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURI won't be commenting on your
mistakes and pitfalls because
again, I leave it in your hands.<WAI0260<CLO

<DNP2002<FLJ2002:0000
<MS2<TURThis game pays homage to two
previous titles:<WAI0140<CLO
<MS2<TURCave Story and Getting Over It
with Bennet Foddy.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURThe first game is pretty obvious,
isn't it?<WAI0260<CLO
<MS2<TURYou probably wouldn't even know
this mod exsists<WAI0140<CLO
<MS2<TURif you haven't at least tried
the original game first<WAI0140<CLO
<MS2<TURand shown a minute iota of
interest in it.<WAI0140<CLO

<MS2<TURAs for the second game by
Mr. Foddy, that one may
have some players at a disconnect.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIf you don't know what that is,
I suggest you pause this mod now,
look it up, maybe play it,<WAI0260<CLO
<MS2<TURthen come back.<WAI0140<CLO

<MS2<TURIf it wasn't a good
game, I wouldn't have made this
mod now, would I?<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2002
<END

#2003
<DNP2003<FLJ2003:0000
<MS2<TURIronically enough, Getting Over It
is itself a homage to an even
older game, Sexy Hiking.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIn Foddy's commentary, which
plays in the game much like
what you're reading now,<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURhe explains that Sexy Hiking
was never meant to
be a high quality game,<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURbut was rather a fun challenge for
the creator to make. The game is
hard and controls poorly,<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURmaking it a very fustrating
experience for any prospective
players (ask me how I know).<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2003
<END
////////////////////////////
#2004
<DNP2004<FLJ2004:0000
<MS2<TURFoddy's game, on the other hand,
is polished and complete, and
is both fair and controls well,<WAI0260<CLO
<MS2<TUReven if it is challenging at times.<WAI0140<CLO

<MS2<TURThis game, although more directly
inspired by Getting Over It, has
more in common with Sexy Hiking.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIt is the product of a passion for
game creation less than a desire
for a smooth user experience.<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2004
<END
////////////////////////////////////
#2005
<DNP2005<FLJ2005:0000
<MS2<TURThe physics are poor, the backend
cobbled, and the final result
rushed.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURTo see this for yourself, take that
fishing rod of yours and ram it
hard into one of the walls.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURYou might be suprised to see it go
all the way though or get stuck
inside.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURUse this mechanic as you will.
I can't complain. I made it.
I left it in.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIt was my choice, made in light of
lack of skill and tight time constraints.
It's part of the game now.<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2005

/////////////////////////////////
#2006
<DNP2006<FLJ2006:0000
<MS2<TURKind of like that Discovery TV
watermark in the bottom right
corner,<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURA remnant of what this mod's base
came from, which was originally
themed around the Mythbusters.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIt's something I chose to keep for
my own amusement, rather than for
polish or user reception.<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2006
<END
///////////////////////////////
#2007
<DNP2007<FLJ2007:0000
<MS2<TURMuch like how Sexy Hiking used
MS paint graphics and MIDI-smash
music,<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURor how you can clip or snap
off obstacles and find yourself
falling out of the world.<WAI0260<CLO

<MS2<TURIt was a project of passion,
not one of polish.<WAI0260<CLO
<FL+2007

#2008
<DNP2008<FLJ2008:0000
<MS2<TURBut still you play,

precious time to take part in my
passion.<WAI0220<CLO
