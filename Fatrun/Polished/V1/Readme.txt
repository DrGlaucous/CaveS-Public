<60 Seconds Mahin Run Version: 1 ~ 2024>

A contender in Modfest 40 (happy 20th anniversary, Cave Story!)



Guide Mahin to the Mahin restaurant before it closes in 60 seconds.
The game uses 3 buttons for control by default: Left, Right, and Up/Z (for jumping, either works).

In case it wasn't apparent, this mod is heavily inspired by "60 Seconds Burger Run", a staple of the flash games that were available on sites like CoolMath.com.
(It's popular enough to have a dedicated speedrunning community if that says anything)
