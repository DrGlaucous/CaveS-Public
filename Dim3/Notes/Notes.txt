cargo run --features=sdl2





three-d quirks:

with GLTF import, all models must have computed tangents if textures are to be used

to make tangents, you can either export them or make them in-code
you need a UV map in order to make the tangents in-code (with the current iterative UV approach, all meshes need a UV map or else the program will crash)


models must have normals, tangents, and uv attributes to be used with a texture.

models that will be used without textures don't need these.
In general, it is good practice to have normals and tangents pre-exported
