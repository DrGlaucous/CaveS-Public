cargo run --features=sdl2





three-d quirks:

with GLTF import, all models must have computed tangents if textures are to be used

to make tangents, you can either export them or make them in-code
you need a UV map in order to make the tangents in-code (with the current iterative UV approach, all meshes need a UV map or else the program will crash)
