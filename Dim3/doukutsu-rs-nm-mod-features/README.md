What is this *branch?*
---

This branch adds several Quality-Of-Life improvements to the game's backend to make it easier to mod. If you're reading this and you're not a modder, this stuff probably doesn't interest you, since it changes nothing flashy about the game itself.

Additions:
- `<BKG` and its sub-commands, which allow for the creation of modular and dynamic backgrounds.
- NOXID-type layer support, (where NOXID is the first user to implement this type of layering system), allowing for multiple tile layers to be drawn on top of each other
- That's all she wrote! *(for now)*

To see how to use these features for modifying the game, please take a look at the the [Documentation](Documentation.md) page.

Also, for more info for modding Cave Story in general, please see the [Community Wiki page](https://wiki.doukutsu.club/).




The rest of this readme is unchanged.

#### Data files

In order to work doukutsu-rs needs to be paired with supported data files. This repository does not contain any data
files.

doukutsu-rs works fine with freeware data files or [NXEngine(-evo)](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo) or from a
supported copy of [Cave Story+](https://www.nicalis.com/games/cavestory+).

<details>

#### Supported game editions and data file acquisition guides

**Freeware**

doukutsu-rs works out of the box when it's placed in the same directory as the original Doukutsu.exe executable. On the initial
startup, doukutsu-rs will automatically extract the additional resources that are embedded in the vanilla game into the `data`
directory. Until that is done, both doukutsu-rs and the vanilla executable have to exist in the directory.

<details>
<summary>Example root directory</summary>

</details>

**Cave Story+**

doukutsu-rs can be used as drop-in replacement for `CaveStory+.exe`. No modifications to game files are needed.

**Original version (first released in 2011 on Steam)** - expand for instructions

<details>
<summary>Steam release (Win/Mac/Linux)</summary>

The `data` folder is in the same place across all platforms.

If you want to use doukutsu-rs as a substitute for Mac version of Cave Story+ (which at moment of writing doesn't work
on 10.15+ anymore), do the following:

1. Find the doukutsu-rs executable:
   - In AppVeyor builds, it's in `doukutsu-rs.app/Contents/MacOS/doukutsu-rs`
   - In your own builds, it's in `target/(release|debug)/doukutsu-rs`
2. Open Steam Library, select `Cave Story+`, press the `Manage` button (gear icon) and select `Properties...`
3. Select `Local Files` and press `Browse...`.
4. Open the `Cave Story+.app` bundle and navigate to `Contents/MacOS` directory.
5. Rename the `Cave Story+` executable to something else or delete it.
6. Copy the doukutsu-rs executable and rename it to `Cave Story+`.
7. Launch the game from Steam and enjoy!

>  [!WARNING]
> **EPIC GAMES STORE VERSION WARNING**
> 
> Nicalis for some reason ships a stray `opengl32.dll` DLL from Windows 7 with the Epic Games Store copies of Cave Story+.
> 
> However as the game is 32-bit and the dll is 64-bit it has no effect on the original version, but as it's a core Windows DLL and doukutsu-rs ships 64-bit builds and uses OpenGL, it's makes the game crash on startup.
> 
> The fix is to simply delete `opengl32.dll`, as it's not used anyway.

**Remastered version (first released in 2017 on Switch)**

> [!NOTE]
> This version is **incompatible** with saves from the original version.
>
> Interchanging the save files may result in spawning in wrong locations, softlocks, graphical glitches, or other issues.

<details>
<summary>Nintendo Switch</summary>

Extract the `data` folder (contained in `romfs`) from your console using tool such as [nxdumptool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool).

**Important notes:**

- doukutsu-rs doesn't rely on the original ROM or executable, you just need the data files, go to `RomFS options` menu to just extract the files to SD card so you don't need to do any extra steps.
- Ensure you're dumping the files **with update included** (`Use update/DLC` option), as 1.0 isn't supported.

**Nintendo Switch homebrew port specific info**

If you're running the homebrew port (drshorizon.nro) on your Switch, you can avoid the dumping step, doukutsu-rs will
automatically detect and mount the data files if you run it over Cave Story+ in Title Override mode (hold `R` while starting CS+ and launch d-rs from hbmenu).

You can put your own data files in `/switch/doukutsu-rs/data` directory on SD Card, which will be overlayed over RomFS if
you run it in setup described above.
