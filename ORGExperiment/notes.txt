Trying to understand the TSC engine:

There is a compiler, decompiler, and parser.

The engine supports both encrypted and unencrypted TSC, as well
as both english and japanese "JIS" emcoding


When loading a TSC file, it is first decrypted, then "Compiled"
into a series of opcodes of individual events, each one starting with '#'
the event is stored at event OPCode, A back-to-back series of numbers (each compiled into a byte length that is optimal), and unicode text (also converted)


(unlike vanilla cave story where the whole file is parsed as an event is needed, this puts each event into an indexable 'cell' to be retrieved later)





Stage select menu

when [the menu] is initialized, the game will check for my custom JSON file that contains the highscores for each stage and compare it to the entries in the stage table
* it will display all entries in the stage.tbl in a list
if there are entries that are alike in both places, the score will be placed on the menu, too
