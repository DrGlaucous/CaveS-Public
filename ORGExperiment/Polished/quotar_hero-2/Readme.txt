Version: 2

A contender in modfest 37

This release only contains 3 completed songs, though more are quite easy to add.

For photosensitive players, it may be necessary to turn off lighting effects in settings. I don't believe the effects are extreme, but this is a CYA warning.
The song "Head Up High" may break this rule, since it makes use of a script dubbed "SuperStrobe". Take that as you will.

Default controls use keys '1', '2', '3', '4' for the corresponding notes on the note highway, but these can (and probably should) be rebound in the settings.
