<Does Not Commute (Cave Story Edition) Version 2.0.0.3 ~ 2024>
This mod is based on the hit mobile game, [Does not] Commute by mediocre,
a game where the player must drive cars to specific destinations within a time limit all while avoiding the cars they have driven previously.

This game follows a similar idea, with the player traveling to destinations within each map while needing to
beat the timer and avoid friendly fire from their previous playthroughs.

Several things to note:
- Any RED tinted bullet CAN hurt the player, so watch out.
- The small blinking clocks give the player a time bonus. The time they give varies, so be sure to get the hard to reach ones.
- Use "Q" to skip through dialouge and cutscenes


====Changelog====
2.0.0.3:
- Fixed several TSC bugs and spelling mistakes
